				Vertical Mat is a project dedicated to finding the balance between a homogeneous space and a heterogeneous space. It takes inspiration from the circulation path of the OMA Netherlands Embassy, multiplying, straightening, and retwisting it to align with the homogeneous city grid of lower Manhattan. Along this reformulated circulation system, clusters of transformed Jean Prouve's Petrol Stations, featuring heterogeneous geometries, are strategically arranged. 
				<br> <br>
				By incorporating the inherent height shift of the circulation path, the 2D system transforms into a dynamic 3D homogeneous system. This innovative design enables multiple different paths for accessing any floor at any height, akin to the intricate pathways found in living organisms. The building serves as a living creature that can continuously develop and grow by incorporating additional individual and grouped office units.
				<br> <br>
				This website is built to showcase model chunks of project Vertical Mat, allow people to walk around and to get a more direct understanding of how furniture-like elements can transform into building clusters, and how clusters aggregate into a growing building system.
